# ðŸ“¦ Compiled Scripts

This folder contains compiled versions of the script XTouch Mini for Ableton Live.

ðŸ‘‰ Please copy these files into the folder `Ableton/User Remote Scripts`.

The user manual will guide you through the installation and use of this script.

IMPORTANT: The compiled script available here is a DEMO version limited to 10 minutes and requires the purchase of a license for unlimited use. The purchase can be made soon on the website or by leaving me a message.

Thank you for your support and have Fun.
