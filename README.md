# 🎛️ XTouch Mini Script

This script customizes the **Behringer X-Touch Mini** controller for advanced use with **Ableton Live**, overcoming the limitations of the native Mackie mode driver.

---

## 🚀 Why This Script?

To address the many shortcomings of the native driver provided for the X-Touch Mini in Mackie mode, I decided to completely redevelop it. I started from a nearly blank slate, asking myself what features I would want on such a controller, considering its limited number of physical buttons.

### 🔧 Development Goals:
- **Full Mixer Mode**:  
  - Top buttons → control **SOLO** tracks  
  - Bottom buttons → control **MUTE** tracks  
  - Potentiometers (VPOTs) → control **volume**

- **Advanced Per-Track Mode**:  
  - Top buttons → assigned to **SOLO** or **MUTE**  
  - Bottom buttons → control **transport** and advanced functions such as:  
    - Smart parameter control of an **EQ8 equalizer**  
    - Manipulation of **ADSR** functions on a synthesizer
    - Control of racks, drum kit pads
   
- **Full user manual**
